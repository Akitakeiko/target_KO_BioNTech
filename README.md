# Thesis project: Transcriptional insights into target KO-enhanced T cells: assessing phenotypic states, clincal relevance and safety concerns

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis pipelines and sample codes for my thesis project focused on identifying and analyzing target knockout genes to enhance T cell therapy. Due to sensitivity and confidentiality requirements, specific gene names have been masked with aliases and some references to target genes have been omitted. The pipelines showcased here are limited to those using publicly derived datasets.

## Repository Contents

### Sample Analysis Codes
- **1. Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data Analysis**: This pipeline processes single-cell RNA sequencing data to explore gene expression profiles in modified T cells. It includes steps for quality control, normalization, and differential expression analysis.

- **2. Mouse to Human Gene Name Conversion**: A utility script for converting gene names from mouse nomenclature to corresponding human nomenclature, with the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) data, used to facilitate cross-species analysis and comparison in gene expression.

- **3. sgRNA Rank Plot Analysis**: An analysis tool for ranking sgRNAs based on their efficiency and effectiveness in gene editing, crucial for selecting optimal sgRNAs for knockout experiments.

### Data
Due to the sensitive nature of the data, this repository does not include raw datasets. Example datasets used are derived from public sources and serve as templates for the analysis pipelines.

## Contributing
While this project is primarily for my thesis, contributions or suggestions for improvements are welcome. Please open an issue to discuss potential changes or enhancements.

## Confidentiality Notice
Please note that this repository contains masked data and altered references to comply with confidentiality agreements. The methodologies and analyses are designed to be reproducible with any publicly available dataset.
